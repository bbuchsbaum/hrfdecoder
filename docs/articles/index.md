### Tutorials

Start here for a guided introduction to hrfdecoder. These tutorials walk
you through the core workflow step by step.

- [Getting started with
  hrfdecoder](https://bbuchsbaum.github.io/hrfdecoder/articles/01-getting-started.md):

  Quick tour of the core workflow for HRF-aware weakly supervised
  decoding.

### How-tos

Task-oriented recipes for specific use cases. Each guide focuses on
solving one particular problem.

- [AR prewhitening for temporal
  autocorrelation](https://bbuchsbaum.github.io/hrfdecoder/articles/02-ar-prewhitening.md):

  Handle fMRI temporal autocorrelation with autoregressive prewhitening.

- [Integrating with rMVPA
  workflows](https://bbuchsbaum.github.io/hrfdecoder/articles/03-rmvpa-integration.md):

  Run searchlight analysis and cross-validation using the rMVPA
  framework.

### Explanations

Conceptual deep dives into how hrfdecoder works. Learn about the
algorithms, design decisions, and theoretical foundations.

- [Understanding HRF
  estimation](https://bbuchsbaum.github.io/hrfdecoder/articles/04-hrf-estimation.md):

  Learn how hrfdecoder jointly estimates the hemodynamic response
  function.
